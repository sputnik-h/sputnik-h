# 👋 Hi, I'm Ethan!
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Data enthusiast with a keen interest in leveraging data to uncover insights, build predictive models, and drive decision-making. I am eager to kickstart my career in Data Science and contribute to impactful projects that solve real-world problems.

## 🌟 About Me
🎓 Education: BA in Psychology and Communication @UCLA, MS in Business Analytics @USC.
📊 Focus Areas: Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Causal Inference, Time Series Forecasting, NLP.
🛠️ Skills: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), SQL, SAS, Tableau.
📈 Interests: Predictive modeling, data visualization, causal inference, and deep learning.

## 🧑‍💻 Projects
Here are some of the projects that showcase my skills and interests:

**1. Streaming Influence: Analyzing the Causal Impact of Twitch Viewership on Active Player Engagement:**

This project aims to analyze the causal relationship between a game’s Twitch viewership and its active player engagement, using Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege as the primary case study. The analysis extends to other popular online multiplayer shooting games, such as Counter-Strike 2 and Rust.

**- Tech Stack:** Python, Time series analysis, Casual inference

**- Highlights:** Found signficant casual links between streaming viewership and active player count. Estimated causal effect between 2%-4%, with time-delayed effect.

**2. Identifying Real vs. AI-Generated Shoes Using Convolutional Neural Networks:**

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between real and AI-generated images of shoes, addressing the challenges of authenticity and trust in visual media

**- Tech Stack:** Python, Deep learning, TensorFlow 

**- Highlights:** Achieved a classification accuracy of 93.8%.

[Project Name]: A time series analysis project.

Tech Stack: Python, Tigramite, Statsmodels
Highlights: Analyzed causal relationships in time series data, developed forecasting models.

| [**1. Streaming Effect: Analyzing the Causal Impact of Twitch Viewership on Active Player Engagement**](https://github.com/sputnik-h/streaming-influence-on-game-popularity)             | Analyzes the causal relationship between a game’s Twitch viewership and its active player engagement, with a primary case study on Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, extending to other games like Counter-Strike 2 and Rust.                                                                                                  | Python, Time series analysis, Causal inference | Found significant causal links between streaming viewership and active player count. Estimated causal effect between 2%-4%, with time-delayed effect. |
| [**2. Real Shoes or not: AI vs. Real Image Classification**](https://github.com/sputnik-h/fake-vs-real-images)                                   | Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between real and AI-generated images of shoes, addressing authenticity and trust in visual media.                                                                                                                                                                     | Python, Deep learning, TensorFlow      | Achieved a classification accuracy of 93.8%.                                                            |
| [**3. Gold Forecast: Predicting Gold Price Trends Using Neural Networks**](https://github.com/sputnik-h/gold-price-prediction-nn)                 | Uses a deep learning model to predict daily changes in gold prices by analyzing financial indicators like the S&P 500, Consumer Price Index, and prices of other precious metals, helping investors make informed decisions.                                                                                                   | Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Google Cloud | Achieved a prediction accuracy of 78.9% with a fully deployed interactive web application on Google Cloud.|
